## Try it out

The ES examples use the Parcel bundler.

### Basic example

Just load the index.html file in basic_example into a browser.
This one uses a CDN and requires no other files to show a map.

### Basic ES example

Testing using the "ES module" version
to show the use of a transpiler.

```bash
cd basic_es_example
npm install
npm run copy
npm start
```

### React example

Test to show the use of React.

```bash
cd react_example
npm install
npm run copy
npm start
```

## TO DO

There are probably unneeded packages included in the ES example.
I worked backwards from a React example.
